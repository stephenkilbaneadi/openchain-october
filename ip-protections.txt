## Tue 01 Oct 2024 - Opening Scene

BLAKE: It took a big push, but my team has finally got the new version of the product ready.
JENNA: Just in time! The customer wants to review it on Monday.
BLAKE: Monday? No problem – I’ll email it across to them now.
JENNA: Wait – you’re just going to give it to them? The company’s invested a lot of R&D into this new product. It contains a lot of new Intellectual Property, and you’re just going to hand it over to them like that?
BLAKE: No problem – we’ve already got an NDA in place, so we’re covered.

-- RECORD SCRATCH --
-- FREEZE-FRAME --

JENNA: Yep. That's me. And that's a typical Monday for me.
JENNA: Just another watercooler conversation with Blake causally mentioning he's about to torpedo years of R&D.
NARRATOR: Does Blake do this a lot?
JENNA: Oh, great. Now I'm hearing disembodied voices.
NARRATOR: No, no. It's fine. I'm a narrative device.
JENNA: Well, as long as my rapid onset of insanity is employing literary techniques, I guess that's fine.
NARRATOR: Can we get back to Blake?
JENNA: Sure.
NARRATOR: Thank you.

NARRATOR: So, tell me about Blake?
JENNA: He's enthusiastic. He has good ideas. But he's completely ignorant of our IP management procedures and why we have them.
NARRATOR: Sounds like a good example for OpenChain October, then.
JENNA: OpenChain October? Oh, is that that thing where you guys post something educational each day about open source license compliance processes?
NARRATOR: (dryly) Well, it worked last time.
JENNA: Did you just say "dryly"? In parentheses.
NARRATOR: Narrative device. Go with it.
JENNA: Forget I mentioned it.
NARRATOR: But yes: throughout the month, we'll follow your experiences with Blake, and see what we can can learn. With your permission, of course.
JENNA: Oh, I like it when my hallucinations understand consent.
NARRATOR: Be nice.
NARRATOR: So, are you in?
JENNA: Sure.
NARRATOR: Great! Let's kick off tomorrow.



## Wed 02 Oct 2024 - What IS "IP"?

JENNA: Okay, Blake. Let's start with the basics. You know we've put a lot of R&D into this product and developed some new IP, yes?
BLAKE: Sure. That's why the customer wants it so urgently.
JENNA: Right. But what *is* "IP".
BLAKE: Uh, "Intellectual Property". Duh.
JENNA: No, I mean, what counts as "Intellectual Property"?
BLAKE: Oh, that's easy! It's.... Er... It's... well...
JENNA: I'll wait.

-- Birds tweet --
-- Crickets chirp --

JENNA: Let me save you some trouble.
JENNA: WIPO - that's the World Intellectual Property Organization - defines "Intellectual Property" as “creations of the mind, such as: Inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce”.
BLAKE: "Creations of the Mind" sound like a prog-rock band.
JENNA: Fair.

JENNA: Organisations that create IP - like us - want to ensure that our IP is protected, and that we are compensated fairly when we allow others to use our IP.
JENNA: That's how organisations like us make money.
JENNA: So - do we PROTECT our IP?
BLAKE:
JENNA:
BLAKE: Oh no! This isn't going to be another mandatory cybersecurity lecture, is it?
JENNA: Worse.
BLAKE: ...did you just crack your knuckles?

JENNA: Yes, there's things like physical security and cyber security, but we start with *legal* protections.
BLAKE: Oh, you mean the police?
JENNA: 
BLAKE:
JENNA: No.

JENNA: By "legal" protection, I mean things that are recognised by legal jurisdictions.
JENNA: There are different methods you can use to protect IP, depending on the kind of IP it is.
JENNA: This includes patents, copyrights, trade marks, non-disclosure agreements, trade secrets and licenses, among others.
BLAKE: Oh god. This is going to involve PowerPoint slides, isn't it?

# Thu 03 Oct 2024 - The "IP Train line"

NARRATOR: We create value by creating innovative or enabling concepts. In turn, these innovations enable our customers to add additional value to their own products. Intellectual Property Protection protects our R&D investment, and our business, by allocating ownership to our creations, and by recognizing others’ creations. This identifies what is “ours”, and what is “theirs”, and allows us to safely share our innovations with our customers – for a price (or for other value, but maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves here)!
NARRATOR: Think of this like a train that goes from one end of the line to the other and back again. We put our IP on the train at our end of the line. It goes to our customer, who puts their IP on it too, and onwards to the end of the line, adding more IP at each stage until it gets to the end user at the other end of the line. The end user puts their payment on the train and sends it back. Each stage in the supply chain takes their payment and sends the remainder back, until the train gets back to us, with our payment for our IP on it.

NARRATOR: If our company does not properly protect its IP, we may find that we are sharing our innovations too freely, allowing others to profit from our investments without compensating us in return. Effectively, we would be funding R&D so that they can make money instead of us.
NARRATOR: In the example of our train, it would be like our immediate customer taking all the money off the train, so there's nothing left for us. 

NARRATOR: Our company expects others to respect our IP, and to compensate us accordingly. Equally, Our company respects others’ IP as well. We must make sure that we only use others’ IP with their permission, and in accordance with any conditions of that use. Otherwise, we could be exposing ourselves to significant legal and financial liability, and we could seriously damage our reputation and our business.
NARRATOR: The train doesn't start with us. We're not really at one end of the line. We're a stop on the way, adding our IP to that of others, and making sure that we sent our payment back as required.
BLAKE: See? I said there'd be slides.
JENNA: Be nice.


# Fri 04 Oct 2024 - Methods of Protecting IP.

JENNA: Let's start with patents.
JENNA: Patents protect inventions. They generally apply to physical embodiments of those inventions (or at least, inventions that have some impact on the real world). Some types of invention can't be patented, and to complicate things further, the rules about what is patentable and what isn't vary from country to country. The invention also has to be new. You cannot patent “a method for tying bowties” because people have been tying bowtie knots for centuries, but you can patent a machine that implements a new method for tying bowties. Patents encourage innovation by granting the inventor exclusive rights to manufacture the invention. To get a patent, you have to apply for registration at the patent office.
BLAKE: It's a silly idea, anyway - you can buy bow ties that just clip on. No tying necessary. Keep up, people!

JENNA: Copyright protects a particular creative expression. For example, you cannot copyright a story, but you can copyright the particular combination and sequence of words that tell that story. Copyright is used to protect media such as books, movies, photographs, music and other artforms. Copyright is also used to protect software, as software is regarded by copyright as similar to written works. Software is written as text, in a programming language, and consists of a particular sequence of instructions, written in that language, to implement an abstract concept. It is the way that the particular sequence of instructions is expressed in writing that is protected.

JENNA: Copyright literally means that the creator has the right to create copies. Others do not have that right, unless the owner of the copyright grants them that right (or some form of legal exception applies). 
JENNA: We'll come back to this when we talk about licences. Also bear in mind that copyright happens automatically, so it's a lot easier to obtain copyright than it is a patent. 
NARRATOR: Foreshadowing! Nice!
JENNA: Hush.
NARRATOR: What? I'm a narrative device - of course I like it when other literary devices are used. And while I'm at it, it's worth pointing out that although Jenna is clearly a highly accomplished and competent individual, she's also fictional, and as such is incapable of holding any form of legal qualification. You should therefore not treat anything she says as legal advice. 

JENNA: Trademarks are used to identify and distinguish a single source or origin of goods and services in a particular marketplace. Trademarks represent the goodwill that trademark owners have established by marketing their products and services through names, brands, symbols, slogans, colors, and even sounds. 
JENNA:
BLAKE:
JENNA: Are you even listening?
BLAKE: I was just getting some more coffee. You sounded like you were going to be a while.
JENNA: This IS for YOUR benefit.
BLAKE: Okay. I'm listening now. Where were we?
JENNA: WE were about to start talking about NDAs.

JENNA: A Non-Disclosure Agreement, also known as an NDA, outlines the confidential information that parties wish to share to conduct business, but at the same time will limit what each party can do with such information. Each party, by signing the NDA, understands and assures the importance of keeping the shared information confidential. They also agree not to use the information for any purpose unless it's set out in the NDA. Always make sure that an NDA is read and signed by both parties before sharing any confidential information. 

JENNA: A trade secret is 1) information that is not generally known outside an organization’s control, 2) the organization derives economic value or business advantage from that information not being generally known, and 3) the organization makes reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of that information.  This type of information may include client lists, marketing plans, production processes, chemical formulas, and proprietary source code.
BLAKE: "Chemical formulas"? We're a software company.
JENNA: It's just an example, Blake.

JENNA: Finally--
BLAKE: Oh thank god!
JENNA: FINALLY, a license is a legal permission whereby the owner of the IP grants another party some rights to that IP, and usually that permission is subject to certain conditions – such as paying for the privilege. In particular, software is typically licensed, not sold. As the author of our software, our company owns the copyright to that software, and so owns all the rights to that IP, but we can also grant specific rights to the software to our customers, through a licence to the customer.

# Friday 04 Oct 2024 - Knowledge Check

Examples, presented in a random order and requiring some checkbox/selection:
•	Our company sells a sensor that implements a new type of non-invasive blood test. What stops our competitors manufacturing copies of this new test?
•	Our company has a computer program for modelling energy efficiency in wind turbines. What stops our competitors from copying this program and using it in their products?
•	A competitor makes their own product which is similar to one of our products. What stops them selling it under the same name, and taking our market?
•	Our company has shared our roadmap plans with some of our lead customers. What stops the customers sharing our plans with our competitors?
•	What stops our competitors from hiring our staff away from us, and learning of our marketing and investment plans through their new hires?
•	What allows us to give a free copy of our software to a customer for evaluation, while still being sure they will pay us for the software when they go into production?

# Friday 04 Oct 2024 - Wrap up

NARRATOR: Now that we've covered the different types of IP projection, let’s go back to Blake and Jenna, and Blake’s plan for delivering the software to the customer.
JENNA: Really? This is going to be weird.
NARRATOR: Just go with it.
-- WAVY-SCREEN EFFECT --
JENNA: Whoa!

BLAKE: It took a big push, but my team has finally got the new version of the product ready.
JENNA: Just in time! The customer wants to review it on Monday.
BLAKE: Monday? No problem – I’ll email it across to them now.
JENNA: Wait – you’re just going to give it to them? The company’s invested a lot of R&D into this new product. It contains a lot of new Intellectual Property, and you’re just going to hand it over to them like that?
BLAKE: No problem – we’ve already got an NDA in place, so we’re covered.

NARRATOR: Is Blake right? Does the NDA protect the IP in the new product? What protections does the NDA give? Here are some choices:

1.	It stops the customer applying for any patents that involve the company's design.
2.	It stops the customer passing any software onwards.
3.	It stops the customer using any software in their own designs.
4.	It stops the customer launching their own product with the same name as the company's product.
5.	It stops the customer going into production and selling their products based on the company's design.
6.	It stops the customer passing on information about Our company’s future roadmap plans. 

NARRATOR: The correct answer is (6). [A GOOD NDA SHOULD COVER ALL OF THIS]
NARRATOR: A Non-Disclosure Agreement stops the customer from passing on confidential information, but it doesn’t prevent them from making use of the company’s product. [AK NOTE: AN NDA WILL USUALLY PREVENT THE MISUSE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING 1-5 ABOVE]

JENNA: An NDA isn’t sufficient. Have you got a license for the software in the product, to make sure the company is protected?
BLAKE: Not yet. But we’ve got an NDA.
JENNA: What if there’s a bug in the software, and the customer’s eval product injures someone? We could be liable. An NDA will stop them passing on confidential information, but you need a software licence to limit our liability and protect us from lawsuits.
BLAKE: I hadn’t thought of that. [AK NOTE - NDA WILL NORMALLY INCLUDE EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY AND ALSO FREQUENTLY AN INDEMITY PROTECTING HE DISCLOSING PARTY FROM ANY LOSSES ARISING FROM THE MISUSE OF THE IP BY THE RECIPIENT]

JENNA: And weren’t you going to file some patents on the new IP?
BLAKE: That’s the plan, yes.
JENNA: If you give the product to the customer now, what’s to stop the customer filing those patents first, ahead of you? [THE NDA]
BLAKE: …..maybe I better hold off on the release for now.
JENNA: Maybe you should.

NARRATOR: Jenna is right to be concerned. It looks like Blake needs a better understanding of the IP protection methods.
NARRATOR: Throughout this month, we’ll be looking at two of them in more detail: copyrights and software licenses.
